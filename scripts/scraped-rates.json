The current allocation charge percentage is 0%. After contract issue, the allocation charge percentage can only change when specified criteria are met, and can never be greater than the maximum allocation charge percentage of 2.5%.\n\n2 Index not available in Iowa. \n\nThe rates are guaranteed for the length of the crediting period. They are declared at issue and at the end of the crediting period. The minimum monthly cap for the monthly sum with cap crediting method is 0.50%. The minimum annual cap for the annual point-to-point with cap crediting method is 0.25%. The minimum annual participation rate for the annual point-to-point with a participation rate crediting methods is 5%. The minimum annual participation rate for the MY 2-year and MY 5-year point-to-point with a participation rate crediting methods is 5%. The minimum interest rate is 0.10%.\n\nThe premium bonus and interest bonus are credited only to the Protected Income Value. To receive the PIV, including the bonus, the contract must be held for at least 10 contract years, and then lifetime income withdrawals must be taken. You will not receive the bonuses if the contract is fully surrendered or if traditional annuitization payments are taken. If it is partially surrendered the PIV will be reduced proportionally, which could result in a partial loss of bonuses. Income withdrawals are considered partial withdrawals and are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to 59½, a 10% federal additional tax. Because this is a bonus annuity, it may include higher surrender charges, longer surrender charge periods, lower caps, or other restrictions that are not included in similar annuities that don't offer a bonus feature.\n\n(C54370-MVA, R95352-MVA, ICC16C54370-MVA).\n\nLinks\nMy Contract (log-in required)\nHow the product works\nUnderstanding Rate Lock for FIAs (for financial professional – log-in required)\nAllocation charge criteria\n\nThe indexes available within the contract are constructed to keep track of diverse segments of the U.S. or international markets, or specific market sectors.

Bonus annuities may include higher withdrawal charges, longer withdrawal charge periods, lower caps, lower participation rates, or other restrictions that are not included in similar annuities that don't offer a bonus feature.\n\n(C64237-MVA, R95581-01-MVA, ICC17C64237-MVA)\n\nLinks\nMy Contract (log-in required)\nHow the product works\nUnderstanding Rate Lock for FIAs (for financial professional – log-in required)\nAllocation charge criteria\n\nThe indexes available within the contract are constructed to keep track of diverse segments of the U.S. or international markets, or specific market sectors.

Instead, it offers growth opportunities by tracking the performance of one or more market indices.1\n\nShield Level Annuities include Shield® Level II 6-Year Annuity, Shield® Level II 3-Year Annuity, and Shield® Level II Advisory Annuity.\n\n\n\n\nCould a Shield Level Annuity be right for you?\n\nKristin shares why she chose a Shield Level Annuity for her portfolio.\n\n\n\n\nDiversify your retirement portfolio with a Shield Level Annuity.\nProtect retirement assets\n\nA Shield Level Annuity provides a level of protection to help ensure that losses are limited when markets turn volatile.\n\nParticipate in growth opportunities\n\nWith a Shield Level Annuity, balance is built in. This means that even with a guaranteed level of protection, there are opportunities to take advantage of market growth.\n\nPay no annual fees\n\nUnlike many financial products, there are no annual fees with a Shield Level Annuity.2\n\n2 Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges, and premium tax and other taxes may apply. When a withdrawal is taken, the value of the Shield Option will be adjusted to reflect any gains or losses attributable to an Interim Value calculation. Losses beyond the elected level of protection could be substantial. By providing a level of downside protection, positive index gains may be limited up to a certain percentage, based on the elected rate crediting type. As a result, the contract owner’s return may be lower than the index’s return. An adjustment to the value of the Shield Option to reflect any losses as well as the limitation on positive index gains could be viewed as implicit fees.\n\nUse our interactive tool to see how a Shield Level II Annuity works\nA Shield® Level II Annuity uses a portion of retirement assets to participate in market growth opportunities with a level of downside protection other investment vehicles may not provide. A Shield Level II Annuity is designed to provide some protection in an unpredictable endeavor - investing.\nEach Shield Level II Annuity comes with a choice of available Shield Options, which include an associated term, index, Shield Rate, and rate crediting type. For this demonstration, we will use a Shield Level II Annuity with a 6-year term.\nLet's explore how this product could fit into a retirement portfolio.\nSee Shield Level Annuity Demonstration\nHow It Works\nYour Shield Level Annuity3 can be tailored to your needs by answering four questions:\n\n1. What index or indices do you want to track?\nYou can track the performance of well-known indices: S&P 500® Index (large cap), Russell 2000® Index (small cap), MSCI EAFE Index (international) and Nasdaq-100® (large cap).A,B,C,D\n\n2. How much protection do you want?\nA Shield Level Annuity offers a built-in level of protection called the Shield Rate.4 This protects your assets from some of the losses that can derail plans.\n\n3. How much growth potential do you want?\nThree rate crediting types are available: Cap Rate, Step Rate, and Step Rate Edge. A Fixed Account is also available. If elected, a Fixed Account pays a fixed rate of interest rather than tracking the performance of an index. Your financial professional can help you determine which strategy might work best for you.5\n\n4. How long do you want to invest?\nSelect the term, which is how long you want to invest. A Shield Level Annuity offers 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-year terms. At the end of each term, you can adjust or maintain your Shield Options to meet changing needs.\n\nMore About\nShield Level Annuities\n\nScott and Linda’s Journey\n\nCome along on a scenic journey that explains how a Shield Level Annuity works.\n\nResource Materials\n\nClick here for important information about Shield Level Suite Annuities.

Sales are expected to remain above $100 billion in 2025.\n\nFixed index annuities (FIAs) offer guaranteed minimum interest rates plus the potential for additional growth based on the performance of specific market indexes, such as the S&P 500. \n\nFIAs function similarly to certificates of deposit (CDs) but typically offer higher returns, especially in higher interest rate environments. Evidence of high returns has become evident recently, as some FIA products reached rates as high as 11% at the start of the second quarter of 2025. \n\n“Fixed index annuities are more popular than ever. It’s not just the high interest rates. Additionally, there is so much volatility in the markets, there’s a huge wave of Baby Boomers retiring, and people want income without taking on huge risks.” said Steven Kibbel, Certified Financial Planner (CPF) and founder of Kibbel Financial.\n\nAs of 2024, FIA sales have doubled since 2021 and outsell more than a quarter of the annuity market.A\n\nThat’s no surprise, Kibbel said, noting that FIA’s high rates, particularly when compared to those offered by CDs are a “slam dunk” for investors. \n\n“Insurers have been able to offer more competitive participation rates and higher caps, some as high as 12%,” Kibbel said. “That’s allowing people to see the upside potential. But that’s not going to last. If the Federal Reserve starts to cut, the caps will come down, and new contracts aren’t as appealing.”\n\n\nWhile rates are attractive, so too is the stability that FIAs can offer, even if volatile markets. \n\nKibbell reflected on a couple in their early 60s who recently wanted to rollover a portion of their 401(k) plan.\n\n“They were tired of stressing about market volatility,” he noted. “We used an FIA to lock in some gains, protect the principal, and establish an income floor.”\n\nGetting Up to Speed on FIA’s\n\nFIAs are clearly a popular choice among investors who want a level of stability and the growth potential. If you’re considering an FIA, here are several questions to ask and things to know when talking to your annuity provider or financial advisor.\n\nWhat Should I Know About FIAs?\n\nSavers and investors should understand that FIAs offer the potential for growth without the risk of losing principal, but they come with limitations. \n\n“There’s usually a cap on the returns, meaning that while the annuity can participate in market growth, there’s a limit to how much it can earn in a good year,” said Oliver Morissey, founder of Empower Wills and Estate Lawyers. \n\n“It’s crucial to ask providers about these caps, participation rates and whether there are any additional fees. It’s also worth discussing the annuity’s surrender period; penalties can apply if you need to withdraw funds early.”\n\nHow Are My Investment Returns Formulated?\n\nThere’s a great deal of innovation in the annuity sector, as insurers roll out more customized index strategies and tweak terms to stay competitive. \n\n“Yet the complexity of these products hasn’t gone away,” said Elizabeth Rivelli, a personal finance and insurance expert at Best Money. “Terms vary significantly—caps, participation rates, spreads—and they can all impact your returns. Some contracts use annual resets; others use point-to-point. It’s important to understand exactly how your gains will be calculated and whether the insurer can change those terms over time.”\n\nWhat’s the Relationship Between FIAs and Interest Rates?\n\nAnnuity consumers must fully understand how interest rates are tightly tied to fixed index annuities.\n\n“Fixed index annuities offer a unique value proposition—capital protection with potential for growth tied to market indices—which makes them particularly appealing when volatility is high but bond yields are also attractive,” said Connor McDougall, CFO at Mapleworthy.com. \n\n“From a strategic perspective, FIAs benefit from both macroeconomic tailwinds and demographic demand.”\n\nThat said, savers and investors should go beyond surface-level returns.\n\n “The most important question to ask is how the insurer calculates credited interest—specifically, what cap rates, participation rates and spread fees apply,” McDougall said. \n\n“These determine how much upside the policyholder actually receives. Another area to explore is liquidity: early withdrawals often come with surrender charges, so understanding access limitations is crucial for long-term planning.”\n\nInterest rates directly influence the competitiveness of FIAs. \n\n“When rates are high, insurers can offer more generous caps and participation terms, which enhance the product’s growth potential,” Connor McDougall added. “But when rates decline, these benefits shrink—and the product can become less attractive than other fixed income options. Also, higher rates may trigger more policy lapses as clients seek better returns elsewhere, so insurers must manage retention carefully.”\n\nWhat Kind of Annuity Should I Get?\n\nThere are different types of fixed index annuities, and investors should understand their options before choosing the best one for their needs. \n\n“Some are built for guaranteed income in retirement, while others are designed for long-term growth with protection against market loss,” said Fradel Barber, Founder and CEO of The World Changers, a financial planning and education company. \n\n“The biggest mistake I see is someone getting an income annuity when what they really wanted was a growth annuity—or the other way around.”\n\nBarber advises potential investors to ask annuity providers if a particular annuity matches their income and growth goals. \n\nIf someone is still a few years away from retirement, they may not need income immediately. “In that case, a growth annuity could help them grow their money safely without riding the stock market rollercoaster,” Barber said.\n\nOther key questions to ask include:\n\nIs my money protected from market loss?\nWhat are the limitations on how much of a return I can earn (e.g., cap, participation rates and spreads)? \nIs my interest rate or crediting method guaranteed? And if so, for how long? “Some are guaranteed for one year, others for five or more,” Barber noted.\nAre there any fees, and what are the surrender charges if I need access to my money?\n\n“The goal is to match the annuity structure to the person’s actual life plan—not just buy one because it sounds good,” Barber added.\n\nEditor Norah Layne contributed to this article.\n\nAd\nQuestions about annuities?\n\nTalk to a licensed annuity expert for free — no sales pressure.

Many people buy between about 45–70 to position retirement guarantees, and often start lifetime income around 70–75 for higher payouts, while also considering liquidity, taxes (59½ rule), and insurer age limits.\nLock In Today’s Best Rates\n5 Min Read\nFact Checked\nWritten By Cliff Ambrose FRC℠, CTS™, CAS® and Hannah Alberstadt\nEdited By Lamia Chowdhury\nReviewed By John Stevenson, CFF\nUpdated: January 21, 2026\nThis page features 10 Cited Research Articles\nRelated Topics You May Like\nWhat Is an Annuity?\nToday’s Best Annuity Rates\nBest Annuity Companies of 2026\nHow to Buy an Annuity\nIncome Annuity Calculator\nHow Are Annuities Taxed?\n\nLock-In Annuity Rates as High as 7.05%!\n\nGet Your Rate Quote\nOverview\nMatch Your Age to Your Goal\nBest Annuity Types by Life Stage\nWhy Payouts Change With Age\nAge Rules and Restrictions\nFrequently Asked Questions\nTable Of Contents\nMatch Your Age to Your Goal\nBest Annuity Types by Life Stage\nWhy Payouts Change With Age\nAge Rules and Restrictions\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nThe “best” age to buy an annuity is the age when you’re within a realistic window of needing the income (or protection) it’s designed to provide. For many people, that’s about 45–70 for buying/positioning, and about 70–75 for starting lifetime income—but the right timing depends on your goals, liquidity needs and annuity type.\n\nA Practical Rule of Thumb: \n\nIf you want income soon: the “best age” is often late 60s to mid-70s, because payouts are typically higher when you’re older and closer to (or in) retirement.\nIf you want a future paycheck later: many buyers position a deferred annuity in their 50s or 60s to lock in guarantees and let value build before income starts. \nIf you’re younger: annuities can fit, but they’re often less likely to be the best first choice if you need maximum liquidity and growth flexibility. \n\n“Sweet spot” ranges are often discussed as ~45 to 70 for purchasing strategy, while ~70 to 75 is commonly cited as a strong window to start payouts, depending on the product and goals.\n\nAge makes a big difference on annuity payouts. An older person in their 70s will have a much higher payout versus someone in their 60s. That said, if someone wants to purchase an annuity at age 60 and begin receiving income 10 years later at age 70, then the income benefit can be substantial. The compound growth effect makes a big difference. A rule of thumb is that if you don’t need the income now, take advantage of an income rider that will provide a high roll-up rate and withdrawal rate for a much larger income in the future.\n\nJohn Stevenson, CFF\nOwner and Advisor at Stevenson Retirement Solutions\nAPM inline gray – Quiz Flow Rates\n\t\t\t\t\nHow soon are you retiring?\nWithin 5 Years\nWithin 10 Years\nAlready Retired\nOther\nNext\nWhat is your goal for purchasing an annuity?\nAccumulation\nIncome\nSecurity of Premium Protection\nInheritance Planning\nOther\nPrevious\nNext\nWhere are you in your search for an annuity?\nStill learning about annuities\nComparing rates or quotes\nReady to purchase an annuity\nPrevious\nNext\nHow much have you saved for retirement?\nThere is no minimum amount required to purchase an annuity, though the national average is $150,000.\n< $49,999\n$50,000 – $149,999\n$150,000 – $249,999\n$250,000 – $499,999\n$500,000 – $999,999\n>$1,000,000\nPrevious\nNext\nYou Qualify for a Free Annuity Rates Consultation!\nFull Name\nEmail Address\nMobile Phone Number\nAge\nZip Code\n\n Privacy & Contact Agreement\n\nWe value your privacy.

Some people use annuities earlier to help grow money with limits on risk, while others turn to them later to protect principal or reduce market stress as retirement approaches. For some, the priority isn’t income at all, but making sure a spouse or heirs are protected. The examples below show how different goals tend to line up with different age ranges.\n\nGrow Money with Guardrails (Accumulation with Some Protection)\n\n\nBest fit timing: often 45–70, especially 50s/60s\n\nWhy: you may have time to let the contract build value before turning it into income.\n\n\nProtect Principal or Reduce Market Stress\n\n\nBest fit timing: commonly late 50s to 70\n\nWhy: many people start valuing stability more as retirement approaches.\n\nLegacy or Spouse Protection Planning\n\n\nBest fit timing: varies widely\n\nWhy: design choices (period-certain, joint life, riders) matter as much as age.\n\nBest Annuity Types by Life Stage\n\nDifferent annuities “fit” at different ages because time horizon and risk tolerance change.\n\nYour stage\tWhat often matters most\tAnnuity types that commonly match\nLate 40s–50s\tGrowth runway + ability to recover from volatility\tVariable annuity (for those who understand market risk/fees) and some fixed indexed annuities for capped upside with limits \n59–70\t“I’m close enough to retirement—I want predictability”\tFixed deferred annuity (guaranteed rate) and some indexed annuities depending on goals \n70–75\tTurn savings into income now; maximize payout per dollar\tSPIA / immediate annuity often highlighted for retirement income starts\n\nThese are patterns, not rules. Certified Financial Planner™ Matt Frankel emphasizes that it can make sense to buy earlier or later depending on goals and risk tolerance, and that a planner can help evaluate options.\n\nWhy Payouts Change With Age\n\nOlder age usually increases payout rates because insurers expect to pay for fewer years, but deferring income can also raise payments through growth. \n\nA Simple Way To Think About It\n\nPayout Rate\nThe income you receive relative to the premium you pay.\n\nWhy It Rises With Age\nThe insurer is pricing based on life expectancy and interest-rate assumptions, so starting later often means larger monthly checks.\nA “Both Can Be True” Example With Real Numbers\n\nImagine two retirees, Linda (60) and Mark (70). Each has $100,000 earmarked for guaranteed retirement income.\n\nMark is 70 and wants income now. He uses his $100,000 to buy an immediate lifetime annuity. Because he’s starting income at 70, the insurer expects a shorter payout period.\n\nHis monthly income might land in the range of $550–$650 per month, starting immediately.\n\nLinda is 60 and doesn’t need income yet. She buys a deferred annuity at 60 and plans to turn income on at 70. Over those 10 years, her annuity grows through interest and compounding.\n\nBy age 70, her contract value might grow to $135,000–$160,000, depending on rates and product features.\nWhen she starts lifetime income, her monthly payment could fall in a similar range — roughly $550–$700 per month.\n\nWhat this shows:\n\nMark’s income is higher now because he’s older.\nLinda’s income later can be just as strong — or stronger — because she combined time + growth + delayed income.\n\nThat’s why there isn’t one best age to buy an annuity. The better question is whether you benefit more from starting income sooner or letting your money grow before turning it on.\n\nSee How Much You Could Earn With Today’s Best Rates\n\nA licensed specialist can review your options and help you secure a strong rate before it changes.\nLock In My Rate Now\nAge Rules and Res",

Depending on the insurance company selling it, it may offer more market upside than an FIA. In a down market, it doesn’t offer as much protection as an FIA but does offer some – markedly more, in fact, than the zero-protection offered by a variable annuity.\n\nStructured variable annuities do not offer guaranteed income riders. (There are surrender charges for premature withdrawals.)\n\nWhat these annuities do offer is a “buffer” on an investor’s liability – typically either 10%, 20% or 30% of the market’s decline during a specified period. For example, if a structured variable annuity contract has a 10% buffer against a market downturn over one year, an investor’s account would lose only 10% of its value if the market dropped by 20% because the insurer bears the first 10% of the market’s loss.\n\nThe more protection an investor signs up for, the less his or her potential to capitalize on an up market. An example of a structured variable annuity offering a generous potential return is one sold by Brighthouse Financial. It offers up to an 11.5% return on the S&P 500 in one year with a 10% buffer. With the same buffer, an investor could earn up to a 45% return over three years on the S&P 500 and up to 200% over a six-year term.\n\nWhat Type of Annuity Shopper Might Like This Product?\nThis annuity targets prospective investors who are relatively conservative but not as conservative as an FIA buyer. They are more willing to take some risk for a bigger potential gain. They are less aggressive, however, than variable annuity owners, who have no protection at all against market losses.\n\nThis depends on the insurance company. There may be only two or three, or, in the case of AXA, up to nine, including non-mainstream indexes such as MSCI Emerging Markets, Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate and Energy SPDR.\n\nHow Diverse Are Investment Options?\nThis depends on the insurance company. There may be only two or three, or, in the case of AXA, up to nine, including non-mainstream indexes such as MSCI Emerging Markets, Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate and Energy SPDR.\n\nWho Are the Players and Do Potential Returns Vary?\nOnly three insurance companies sell this product. In addition to Brighthouse Financial, they are France-based AXA and Alliance Insurance.\n\nReturn potential does vary and can be less than that of an FIA. AXA’s offering, for example, offers a maximum return of 6.3% on the S&P 500 with a 10% buffer and a maximum return of only 22% over three years.\n\nDo Insurance Companies Commonly Offer Both a Structured Variable Annuity and Fixed Index Annuity?\nThe answer is no. Only Alliance offers both. A big reason is simply logistics. Selling a structured variable annuity (or a variable annuity) requires a securities license; selling an FIA does not. Established insurance companies selling FIAs have already built an indirect sales network composed of many advisors who do not have security licenses. These advisors do not sell variable annuities, either.\n\nInformation Request Form\n\nIf you have questions or would like more information, please complete this form and a licensed professional will be happy to help.\n\nName(Required)\nState(Required)\nChoose your state\nEmail Address(Required)\nContact Preference\nChoose a contact method\nby Phone\nby Text Message\nby Email\nPhone Number(Required)\nHow can we help?\n0 of 250 max characters\n I am a financial professional/broker\n Keep me informed of rate & product updates via email\n\nBy providing your information and clicking 'Submit' above, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to this site's privacy policy.
